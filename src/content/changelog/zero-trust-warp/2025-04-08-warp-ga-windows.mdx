A new GA release for the Windows WARP client is now available on the [Stable release downloads page](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/).   This release contains a hotfix for captive portal detection for the 2025.2.600.0 release.

**Changes and improvements**

- Fix to reduce the number of browser tabs opened during captive portal logins.

**Known issues**

- DNS resolution may be broken when the following conditions are all true:
	- WARP is in Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering (tunnel-only) mode.
	- A custom DNS server address is configured on the primary network adapter.
	- The custom DNS server address on the primary network adapter is changed while WARP is connected.

	To work around this issue, reconnect the WARP client by toggling off and back on.
