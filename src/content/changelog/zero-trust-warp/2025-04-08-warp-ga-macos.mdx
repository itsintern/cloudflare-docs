A new GA release for the macOS WARP client is now available on the [Stable release downloads page](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/).   This release contains a hotfix for captive portal detection and PF state tables for the 2025.2.600.0 release.

**Changes and improvements**

- Fix to reduce the number of browser tabs opened during captive portal logins.
- Improvement to exclude local DNS traffic entries from PF state table to
reduce risk of connectivity issues from exceeding table capacity.

**Known issues**

- macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP
client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.4
or later.
