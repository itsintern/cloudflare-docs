We've deployed a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule to all sites on Cloudflare to protect against the [Next.js authentication bypass vulnerability](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw) (`CVE-2025-29927`) published on March 21st, 2025.

* This managed rule protects sites using Next.js on Workers and Pages, as well as sites using Cloudflare to protect Next.js applications hosted elsewhere.
* This rule has been automatically deployed to all sites as part of our [WAF Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) and blocks requests that attempt to bypass authentication in Next.js applications.
* The vulnerability affects almost all Next.js versions, and is patched in Next.js `14.2.25` and `15..2.3`. **Users on older versions of Next.js (`11.1.4` to `13.5.6`) do not have a patch available**.

The managed WAF rule mitigates this by blocking _external_ user requests with the `x-middleware-subrequest` header regardless of Next.js version, but we recommend users using Next.js 14 and 15 upgrade to the patched versions of Next.js as an additional mitigation.

Note that you can choose to disable this rule by configuring a [managed ruleset exception](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/create-exception/) for ruleId `34583778093748cc83ff7b38f472013e`.
