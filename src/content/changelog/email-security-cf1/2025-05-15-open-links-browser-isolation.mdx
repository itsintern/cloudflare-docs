You can now safely open links in emails to view and investigate them.

![Open links with Browser Isolation](~/assets/images/changelog/email-security/browser-rendering-links.jpg)

From **Investigations** â†’ **View details**, look for the **Links Identified** section. Next to each link, an **Open in Browser Isolation** icon allows your team to safely open the link in a clientless, isolated browser with no risk to the analyst or your environment. Learn more about this feature on our [docs](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#open-links).

To use this feature, you must:

- Enable **Clientless Web Isolation** in your Zero Trust settings.
- Have **Browser Isolation (BISO)** seats assigned.
  For more details, refer to our [setup guide](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/).

This feature is available across all CES packages:

- Advantage
- Enterprise
- Enterprise + PhishGuard
