releaseNotes: |-
  This release contains improvements and new exciting features, including [post-quantum cryptography](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/#enable_post_quantum). By tunneling your corporate network traffic over Cloudflare, you can now gain the immediate protection of post-quantum cryptography without needing to upgrade any of your individual corporate applications or systems.

  **Changes and improvements**
  - Fixed a device registration issue causing WARP connection failures when changing networks.
  - Captive portal improvements and fixes:
     - Captive portal sign in notifications will now be sent through operating system notification services.
     - Fix for firewall configuration issue affecting clients in DoH only mode.
  - Improved the connectivity status message in the client GUI.
  -  The WARP client now applies post-quantum cryptography end-to-end on enabled devices accessing resources behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. This feature can be [enabled by MDM](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/#enable_post_quantum).
  - Improvement to handle client configuration changes made by MDM while WARP is not running.
  - Fixed an issue affecting Split Tunnel Include mode, where traffic outside the tunnel was blocked when switching between Wi-Fi and Ethernet networks.
  - Added a WARP client device posture check for SAN attributes to the [client certificate check](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/client-certificate/).
