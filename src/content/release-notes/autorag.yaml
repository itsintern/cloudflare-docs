    title: Errored files will now be retried in next sync
    description: |-
      Files that fail to index will now be automatically retried in the next indexing job. For instance, if a file initially failed because it was oversized but was then corrected (e.g. replaced with a file of the same name/key within the size limit), it will be re-attempted during the next scheduled sync.

    title: Fixed character cutoff in recursive chunking
    description: |-
      Resolved an issue where certain characters (e.g. '#') were being cut off during the recursive chunking and embedding process. This fix ensures complete character processing in the indexing process.

    title: EU jurisdiction R2 buckets now supported
    description: |-
      AutoRAG now supports R2 buckets configured with European Union (EU) jurisdiction restrictions. Previously, files in EU-restricted R2 buckets would not index when linked. This issue has been resolved, and all EU-restricted R2 buckets should now function as expected.
