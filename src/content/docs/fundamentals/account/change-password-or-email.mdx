## Change password

:::note
If your administrator has [enabled Single sign-on (SSO)](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/dash-sso-apps/), you cannot change your **Authentication** settings.
:::

To change your Cloudflare password:

1. Go to your [Profile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/profile).
2. Select your account.
3. Select **Authentication**.
4. On **Password**, select **Change**.
5. Change your password and select **Save**.

For added account security, consider changing your [API tokens](/fundamentals/api/how-to/roll-token/) as well.

## Change email address

:::note

You cannot change your email address if your administrator has [enabled single sign-on (SSO)](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/dash-sso-apps/) or if you did not successfully verify the original email address. 

For example, if the email address was entered incorrectly or is a non-working email address, you will need to create a new account with a working email address and [move domains](/fundamentals/manage-domains/move-domain/).

:::

To change the email address associated with your Cloudflare account:

1. Go to your [Profile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/profile).
2. Select your account.
3. In the Email Address panel, select **Change Email Address**.
4. In the dialog, enter your new email address in **New email** and **Confirm email**.
5. Enter your current password.
6. Select **Save**.
