## Account name

Your account name defaults to `<<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>>'s Account`.

You may want to customize the name of this account, either to help specify its purpose or to help associate it with multiple accounts.

To change your account name:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **Manage Account** > **Configurations**.
3. For **Account Name**, select **Change Name**.
4. Enter a new account name.
5. Select **Save**.

## Appearance

If you want to adjust how the Cloudflare dashboard appears on your device, you can adjust relevant settings in your account **Profile**.

To update appearance preferences:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **My Profile**
3. For **Appearance**, choose a value:
   * **Dark**: Defaults to darker colors.
   * **Light**: Defaults to lighter colors.
   * **Use system setting**: Defaults to whatever is used on your device.
4. Your dashboard display will update to the new appearance setting automatically.

## Communication preference

When you create an account, Cloudflare automatically chooses your **Communication Preferences**, or when Cloudflare might occasionally send you emails.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **My Profile**.
3. For **Communication Preferences**, select **Edit**.
