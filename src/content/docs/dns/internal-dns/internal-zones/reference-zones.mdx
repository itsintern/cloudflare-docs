## Steps

To set up a reference zone, use the [Update DNS settings](/api/resources/dns/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) endpoint. In `--data`, specify the `internal_dns` object with the parameter `reference_zone_id`.

<Example>
<Render file="internal-reference-zone-api"/>

A third zone (C) could also point to zone B as a reference, but zone A cannot add another zone as a reference while also having zone B configured as its reference zone.
