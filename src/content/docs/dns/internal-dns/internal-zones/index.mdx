Internal DNS zones are groupings of internal DNS records. While [public DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/) contain information about resources that you want to make available to the public Internet, [internal DNS records](#internal-dns-records) allow you to manage resources that should only be available within your private network.

Refer to [Manage internal zones](/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/setup/) for a full list of configuration conditions and step-by-step instructions.

Internal DNS zones do not get assigned Cloudflare nameservers and can only be queried via [Cloudflare Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/resolver-policies/) when linked to a [DNS view](/dns/internal-dns/dns-views/). The Gateway configuration must exist within the same Cloudflare account where the internal zone exists.

## Reference zones

Refer to [Set up reference zones](/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/reference-zones/) for step-by-step instructions.

## Internal DNS records

Internal zones can contain the same [DNS record types](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/) that Cloudflare supports for public zones.

You can manage internal DNS records in the same way as you would manage public DNS records, with the difference that [proxy status](/dns/proxy-status/) does not apply to internal DNS records.

Refer to [Manage DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) or to the [API documentation](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/) for further guidance.
