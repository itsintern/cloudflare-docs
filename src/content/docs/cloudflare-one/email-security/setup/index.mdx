You can set up Email Security via:

<DirectoryListing />

## Post-delivery deployment

With post-delivery deployment, Email Security scans emails **after** they reach users' inbox.

Post-delivery deployment includes [Microsoft Graph API](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/) and [BCC](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/)/[Journaling](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/journaling-setup/office365-journaling/).

With Microsoft Graph API, you authorize Email Security to scan domains via your email provider credentials. With BCC/Journaling, you send messages to Email Security via BCC or Journaling configurations within your email provider.

When you set up Microsoft Graph API, you get access to the following features:

- Auto-moves.
- Directory synchronization.
- Post-delivery response / Phish submission response.
- Auto pull EMLs for [reclassification](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#reclassify-messages) whose disposition is "None".
- Manually move messages to different inboxes.

If you set up Email Security via BCC/Journaling and you want to access the features listed above, you will need to [associate an integration](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/enable-auto-moves/).

## Pre-delivery deployment

With pre-delivery deployment, Email Security scans emails **before** they reach users' inbox.

MX/Inline allows you to send messages to Email Security to scan before they reach your users' inbox. You may need to update your MX records.

With MX/Inline, you will not be able to auto-move emails.

However, you will need to associate an integration to access the following features:

- Directory synchronization.
- Post-delivery response / Phish submission response.
- Auto pull EMLs for reclassification for disposition "None".
- Manually move messages.
