<Render file="email-security/deployment/mx-deployment-prerequisites"/>

## Requirements

- Provisioned Email Security account.
- Access to the Google administrator console ([Google administrator console](https://admin.google.com/) > **Apps** > **Google Workspace** > **Gmail**).
- Access to the domain nameserver hosting the MX records for the domains that will be processed by Email Security.

## 1. Set up Inbound Email Configuration

Set up [Inbound Email Configuration](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60730?hl=en) with the following details:
    - In **Gateway IPs**, select the **Add** link, and add the IPs mentioned in [Egress IPs](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/egress-ips/).
    - Select **Automatically detect external IP (recommended)**.
    - Select **Require TLS for connections from the email gateways listed above**.
    - Do not select **Reject all mail not from gateway IPs**. You will enable this option at a later time to ensure your mail flows.
    - Select **SAVE**.

## 2. (Optional) Set up an email quarantine

[Set up an email quarantine](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6104172?hl=en#:~:text=Sign%20in%20with%20an%20administrator,t%20access%20the%20Admin%20console.&text=Manage%20quarantines.,Click%20Add%20Quarantine.) with the following details:
        - **Name**: Email Security Malicious.
        - **Description**: Email Security Malicious.
        - For the **Inbound denial consequence**, select **Drop message**.
        - For the **Outbound denial consequence**, select **Drop message**.
        - Select **SAVE**.

To access the newly created quarantine, select **GO TO ADMIN QUARANTINE** or access the quarantine directly by pointing your browser to https://email-quarantine.google.com/adminreview.

## 3. (Optional) Create a content compliance filter

Go to **Compliance**, and create a [content compliance filter](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1346934?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-go-to-gmail-compliance-settings-in-the-google-admin-console%2Cstep-enter-email-messages-to-affect) to send malicious messages to quarantine. Enter the following details:
    - **Content compliance**: Add `Quarantine Email Security Malicious`.
    - **Email messages to affect**: Select **Inbound**.
    - **Add expressions that describe the content you want to search for in each message**:
        - Select **Add** to add the condition.
        - In **Simple content match**, select **Advanced content match**.
        - In **Location**, select **Full headers**.
        - In **Match type**, select **Contains text**.
        - In **Content**, enter `X-CFEmailSecurity-Disposition: MALICIOUS`.
        - Select **SAVE** to save the condition.
    - If the above expression match, do the following, select **Quarantine message** and the **Email Security Malicious** quarantine that was created in the previous step.
        - Select **SAVE**.

If you would like to quarantine the other dispositions, repeat the above steps and use the following strings for the other dispositions:

- `X-CFEmailSecurity-Disposition: BULK`
- `X-CFEmailSecurity-Disposition: SUSPICIOUS`
- `X-CFEmailSecurity-Disposition: SPOOF`
- `X-CFEmailSecurity-Disposition: UCE` (`UCE` is the equivalent of `SPAM`)

If desired, you can create a separate quarantine for each of the dispositions.

## Next steps

Now that you have completed the prerequisite steps, you can set up [MX/Inline](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/) on the Cloudflare dashboard.
