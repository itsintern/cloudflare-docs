To set up MX/Inline:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email Security**.
3. Select **Monitoring**. If you are a first time user, select **Contact sales**. Otherwise, select **Set up**.
4. Select **MX/Inline**.
5. To start the MX/Inline configuration, you will need to have completed the prerequisite setup on your email provider's platform. Once you have completed this step, select **I confirm that I have completed all the necessary requirements**. Then, select **Start configuration**.

If you have verified zones on Cloudflare, continue with the following steps:

1. **Connect a domain**: Select your domain. Then, select **Continue**.
2. **Select position**: This step allows you to choose where Email Security fits into your mail flow and configure position settings:
    - **Select position**: Choose between:
        - **Sit first (hop count = 1)**: Email Security is the first server that receives the email. There are no other email scanners or services between the Internet and Cloudflare.
        - **Sit in the middle (hop count > 1)**: Email Security sits anywhere other than the first position. Other servers receive emails _before_ Email Security. There are other email scanners or email services in between.
    - **Position settings**: Refine how Email Security receives and forwards emails:
        - **Forwarding address**: This is your mail flow next hop after Email Security. This value is auto-filled, but you can still change it.
        - **Outbound TLS**: Choose between:
            1. **Forward all messages over TLS** (recommended).
            2. **Forward all messages using opportunistic TLS**.
    - Select **Continue**.
3. (**Optional**, select **Skip for now** to skip this step) **Configure quarantine policy**: Select dispositions to automatically prevent certain types of incoming messages from reaching a recipient's inbox. 
4. (Optional) **Update MX records**: 
    - Email Security can automatically update MX records for domains that proxy traffic through Cloudflare. Under **Your mail processing location**, select your mail processing location.
    - You can also choose to allow Cloudflare to update MX records by selecting **I confirm that I allow Cloudflare to update to the new MX records**. When Email Security updates MX records, we replace your original MX records with Email Security MX records.
    - Select **Continue**.
5. **Review details**: Review your domain, then select **Go to domains**.

## Users who do not have domains with Cloudflare

If you do not have domains with Cloudflare, the dashboard will display two options:

- Add a domain to Cloudflare.
- Enter domain manually.

### Add a domain to Cloudflare

Selecting **Add a domain to Cloudflare** will redirect you to a new page where you will connect your domain to Cloudflare. Once you have entered an existing domain, select **Continue**.

Then, follow the steps to [Set up MX/Inline](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/).

### Enter domain manually

1. **Add domains**: Manually enter domain names.
2. **Review all domains**: Review all your domains, then select **Continue**.
3. **Verify your domains**: It may take up to 24 hours for your domains to be verified. Select **Done**.
4. Once your domains have been verified, the dashboard will display a message like this: **You have verified domains ready to connect to Email Security**. This means that you can now set up Email Security via MX/Inline. 
5. Select **Set up**, then select **MX/Inline**.
6. Follow the steps to [Set up MX/Inline](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/).
