Secure your email inbox with Email Security.
</Description>

Email Security secures your email inbox by integrating with your existing email provider and blocking phishing attacks, malware, [Business Email Compromise](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) attacks, and vendor email fraud.

Email Security overview page allows you to:

- View [reclassifications](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#reclassify-messages).
- Manage [detection settings](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/).
- [Run screens](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#screen-criteria).

To access your Email Security overview:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Go to **Zero Trust** > **Email Security** > **Overview**.
3. Complete the [setup process](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/).

:::note
If you have not yet purchased Email Security, you can try Email Security with Retro Scan. Refer to [Retro Scan](/cloudflare-one/email-security/retro-scan/) to learn more.

Once you have completed the setup process, the Email Security overview will display:

- A series of recommendations. For example, you may be recommended to learn how to submit emails for reclassification, create policies, or learn how to manage your [impersonation registry](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/).
- Email Security metrics (your email security activity from the last 7 days).
- Recently modified policies, where you will be able to view all modified policies.
- Education and resources: Links to [implementation guides](/cloudflare-one/implementation-guides/), [Email Security changelogs](/cloudflare-one/changelog/email-security/), and [API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/email_security/subresources/investigate/methods/get/).
