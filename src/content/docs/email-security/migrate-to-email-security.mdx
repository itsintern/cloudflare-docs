This page aims at showing you how to perform Area 1 actions in [Zero Trust Email Security](/cloudflare-one/email-security/), and new terminology introduced in Email Security.

:::note
Your Area 1 data and configuration settings are available in Email Security.
:::

## Invite users

In Area 1, you [invite users](/email-security/account-setup/manage-account-members/#add-user) by logging in to the Area 1 portal and inviting members.

To invite users in Zero Trust Email Security:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Go to **Manage Account**.
3. Select **Members** > **Invite** > [Add account members](/fundamentals/manage-members/manage/#add-account-members).

Once you have added new account members, you will have to assign each member an [Email Security role](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/#email-security-roles).

## Create webhooks

In Area 1, you can [create alert webhooks](/email-security/email-configuration/domains-and-routing/alert-webhooks/#create-an-alert-webhook).

In Zero Trust Email Security, webhooks are instead referred to as logs. You can enable [detection logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/enable-logs/#enable-detection-logs) and/or [user action logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/enable-logs/#enable-user-action-logs). Additionally, you can enable [Outbound Data Loss Prevention](/cloudflare-one/email-security/outbound-dlp/) to protect sensitive information in outbound emails.

## Set up system alerts

In Area 1, you can view [statistics](/email-security/reporting/statistics-overview/) of your account in the Home section.

In Email Security, you can:

- Go to [Cloudflare System Status](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/) to view system status for the Cloudflare service.
- Go to [Cloudflare Status API](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/api) to view status information for the API documentation and functionality.
- Configure [Cloudflare Notifications](/notifications/get-started/).

## Contact support

In Area 1, you can reach out to support via the following email addresses:

- support@area1security.com
- phishguard@area1security.com (for PhishGuard customers only)

In Email Security, you can:

- Go to the [Cloudflare Help Center](https://www.support.cloudflare.com/s/?language=en_US)
- [Contact Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/)
- [Raise a ticket](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/#getting-help-with-an-issue) and enter the correct answer to the following questions:
  - What type of question do you have? **Technical - Other Products**
  - In what area can we help you? **Email Security**

## Search emails

In Area 1, you can perform two types of search: [Fielded Search](/email-security/reporting/search/#fielded-search) and [Freeform Search](/email-security/reporting/search/#freeform-search).

In Email Security, the ability to search emails has been expanded. You can use three different [screen criteria](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#screen-criteria) to search emails:

- [Advanced screen](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#advanced-screen)
- [Regular screen](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#regular-screen)
- [Popular screen](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#popular-screen)

## Check metrics

In Area 1, you can check [statistics](/email-security/reporting/statistics-overview/) in your Home section.

In Email Security, you can check your metrics in the [Monitoring](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/) section in the dashboard.

## Move messages to a specific folder

Area 1 allows you to set up [message retraction](/email-security/email-configuration/retract-settings/) to move messages to specific folders. This is known as **retraction**. 

Moving messages to a specific folder is known as [auto-moves](/cloudflare-one/email-security/auto-moves/) in Zero Trust Email Security.

## Create policies

This table displays the difference in terminology used when creating policies:

| Area 1                                                                                        | Email Security                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Allowed patterns](/email-security/email-configuration/lists/allowed-patterns/)               | [Allow policies](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/allow-policies/)               |
| [Block lists](/email-security/email-configuration/lists/block-list/)                          | [Blocked senders](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/blocked-senders/)             |
| [Trusted domains](/email-security/email-configuration/lists/trusted-domains/)                 | [Trusted domains](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/trusted-domains/)             |
| [Text add-ons](/email-security/email-configuration/email-policies/text-addons/)               | [Text add-ons](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/configure-text-add-ons/)         |
| [Link actions](/email-security/email-configuration/email-policies/link-actions/)              | [Link actions](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/configure-link-actions/)         |
| [Added detections](/email-security/email-configuration/enhanced-detections/added-detections/) | [Additional detections](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/additional-detections/) |

## Reclassifications

This table displays the difference in terminology used when finding emails whose disposition is incorrect:

| Area 1 | Email Security |
|--|--|
| Report [false negative](/email-security/email-configuration/phish-submissions/#false-negatives)/[false positive](/email-security/email-configuration/phish-submissions/#false-positives) | [ Reclassify messages ](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#reclassify-messages) |
| N/A | Escalate user submissions |
| [Team submission](/email-security/email-configuration/phish-submissions/#how-to-submit-phish) | [Team submissions](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#team-submissions) |
| [User submission](/email-security/email-configuration/phish-submissions/#how-to-submit-phish) | [User submissions](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#user-submissions) |

## Business Email Compromise

In Area 1, you can set up a [Business email compromise (BEC)](/email-security/email-configuration/enhanced-detections/business-email-compromise/) list to protect against attackers who try to impersonate executives.

In Email Security, this feature is known as [impersonation registry](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/).

## Synchronize directories

In Area 1, you can [integrate directories](/email-security/email-configuration/enhanced-detections/business-email-compromise/#integrating-a-directory) in your email provider.

In Email Security, you can add and sync [directories](/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/).
