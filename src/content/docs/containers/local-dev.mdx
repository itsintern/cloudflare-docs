You can run both your container and your Worker locally, without additional configuration, by running [`npx wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) in your project's directory.

To develop Container-enabled Workers locally, you will need to first ensure that a
Docker compatible CLI tool and Engine are installed. For instance, you can use [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
on Mac, Windows, or Linux.

When you run `wrangler dev`, your container image will be built or downloaded. If your
[wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#containers) sets
the `image` attribute to a local path, the image will be built using the local Dockerfile.
If the `image` attribute is set to a URL, the image will be pulled from the associated registry.

Container instances will be launched locally when your Worker code calls to create
a new container. This may happen when calling `.get()` on a `Container` instance or
by calling `start()` if `manualStart` is set to `true`. Wrangler will
boot new instances and automatically route requests to the correct local container.

When `wrangler dev` stops, all associated container instances are stopped, but
local images are not removed, so that they can be reused in subsequent calls to
`wrangler dev` or `wrangler deploy`.

:::note
If your Worker app creates many container instances, your local machine may not be able to run as many containers concurrently as is possible when you deploy to Cloudflare.

Additionally, if you regularly rebuild containers locally, you may want to clear
out old container images (using `docker image prune` or similar) to reduce disk used.

## Iterating on Container code

When you use `wrangler dev`, your Worker's code is automatically reloaded by Wrangler each time you save a change,
but code running within the container is not.

To rebuild your container with new code changes, you can hit the `[r]` key on your keyboard, which
triggers a rebuild. Container instances will then be restarted with the newly built images.

You may prefer to set up your own code watchers and reloading mechanisms, or mount a local directory
into the local container images to sync code changes. This can be done, but there is no built-in
mechanism for doing so in Wrangler, and best-practices will depend on the languages and frameworks
you are using in your container code.
