## Error 1016: Origin DNS error

This error indicates that Cloudflare cannot resolve the origin web server's IP address.

### Common cause

Common causes for error `1016` are:

- A missing DNS A record that mentions origin IP address.
- A CNAME record in the Cloudflare DNS points to an unresolvable external domain.
- The origin hostnames (CNAMEs) in your Cloudflare [Load Balancer](/load-balancing/) default, region, and fallback pools are unresolvable. Use a fallback pool configured with an origin IP as a backup in case all other pools are unavailable.
- When creating a Spectrum app with a CNAME origin, you need first to create a CNAME on the Cloudflare DNS side that points to the origin. Please see [Spectrum CNAME origins](/spectrum/get-started/#create-a-spectrum-application-using-a-cname-record) for more details.
- There is no DNS record for the hostname in the Cloudflare for SaaS target zone.
- There is no DNS record for the hostname in the target [Partial (CNAME) setup zone](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/) of a Workers subrequest ([Fetch API](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/)).

### Resolution

To resolve error `1016`:

1. Verify your Cloudflare DNS settings include an A record that points to a valid IP address that resolves via a [DNS lookup tool](https://dnschecker.org/).
2. For a CNAME record pointing to a different domain, ensure that the target domain resolves via a [DNS lookup tool](https://dnschecker.org/).
3. For a Workers subrequest to a Partial (CNAME) setup zone, ensure that the hostname exists on the Cloudflare zone (and not only at the authoritative DNS).
