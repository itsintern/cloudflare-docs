Bot Management for Enterprise is a paid add-on that provides sophisticated bot protection for your domain. Customers can identify automated traffic, take appropriate action, and view detailed analytics within the dashboard.

This Enterprise product provides the most flexibility to customers by:

- Generating a [bot score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) of 1-99 for every request. Scores below 30 are commonly associated with bot traffic.
- Allowing customers to take action on this score with [WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) or [`Workers`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties).
- Allowing customers to view this score in Bot Analytics or Logs.

## Enable Bot Management for Enterprise

Bot Management is automatically enabled for Enterprise zones entitled with the add-on.

To enable a [Bot Management](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/bots) trial on Enterprise zones without the Bot Management add-on entitled:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Bots**.
3. Select **Add Bot Management**.

:::note

If you are not seeing Bot Management enabled on your zone or if you still see **Add Bot Management** on the Cloudflare dashboard, contact your account team for the proper entitlements.
:::

## Setup

Cloudflare recommends that you deploy the following basic settings and customize them according to the traffic in your zone.

### Enable the latest Machine Learning version

<Render file="latest-ml-model-enable" />

### Block AI Bots

<Render file="block-ai-bots-enable" params={{ one: "Bot Management" }} />

:::note
You can view blocked AI bot traffic via [Security Analytics](/waf/analytics/security-analytics/).
:::

### Enable JavaScript detections

Enabling [JavaScript detections](/bots/additional-configurations/javascript-detections/) validates that the browser can run JavaScript, and is stored in the `cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed` variable.

<Render file="javascript-detections-enable" params={{ one: "Bot Management" }} product="cloudflare-challenges" />

### Deploy default templates

Cloudflare has [default templates](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules?template=bot_traffic) for definite bots, which have a [bot score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) of 1, and likely bots which have a bot score of 2 to 29. In our templates, Cloudflare recommends to allow verified bots such as Google SEO Crawler and access to cached static resources.

- [Definite Bots template](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone:/security/security-rules/custom-rules/create?template=Definitely%20Bots): Targets malicious bot traffic while ignoring verified bots and routes delivering static content.

    ```txt wrap
    (cf.bot_management.score eq 1 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot and not cf.bot_management.static_resource)
    ```

- [Likely Bots template](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules/custom-rules/create?template=Likely%20Bots): Targets traffic likely to be malicious bots while ignoring verified bots and routes with static content. It may contain a small amount of non-bot traffic.

    ```txt wrap
    (cf.bot_management.score ge 2 and cf.bot_management.score le 29 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot and not cf.bot_management.static_resource)
    ```

- (Optional) [JavaScript detections template](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules/custom-rules/create?template=JavaScript%20Verified%20URLs): If you enabled JavaScript detections, then set up a [managed challenge](/cloudflare-challenges/challenge-types/challenge-pages/#managed-challenge-recommended), make sure to add a method and URI path. JavaScript detections improves security for URLs that should only expect JavaScript-enabled clients.

    ```txt wrap
    (not cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed and http.request.method eq "" and http.request.uri.path in {""})
    ```
