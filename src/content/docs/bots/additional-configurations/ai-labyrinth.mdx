The AI Labyrinth adds invisible links on your webpage with specific `Nofollow` tags to block AI crawlers that do not adhere to the recommended guidelines and crawl without permission. AI crawlers that scrape your website content without permission will be stuck in a maze of never-ending links, and their details are recorded and used by all Cloudflare customers who choose to block [AI bots](/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots).

These links do not impact your search engine optimization (SEO) or your website's appearance, and are only seen by bots. AI bots that respect no-crawl instructions will safely ignore this honeypot.

To enable [AI Labyrinth](/bots/additional-configurations/ai-labyrinth) based on your plan:
