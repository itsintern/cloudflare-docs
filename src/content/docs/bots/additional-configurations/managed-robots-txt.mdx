Protect your website or application from AI crawlers by implementing a `robots.txt` file on your domain to direct AI bot operators on what content they can and cannot scrape for AI model training.

Cloudflare's managed `robots.txt` explicitly disallows known bots engaged in scraping for AI purposes.

AI bots are expected to follow the `robots.txt` directives.

:::note
Respecting `robots.txt` is voluntary. If you want to prevent crawling, use AI Audit's [manage AI crawlers](/ai-audit/features/manage-ai-crawlers/) feature.
:::

## Compatibility with existing `robots.txt` files

Cloudflare will independently check whether your website has an existing `robots.txt` file and update the behavior of this feature based on your website.

### Existing robots.txt file

If your website already has a `robots.txt` file — verified by a HTTP `200` response — Cloudflare will prepend our managed `robots.txt` before your existing `robots.txt`, combining both into a single response.

For example, without this feature enabled, the `robots.txt` content of `crawlstop.com` would be:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /lp
Disallow: /feedback
Disallow: /langtest

Sitemap: https://www.crawlstop.com/sitemap.xml
```

With the managed `robots.txt` enabled, Cloudflare will prepend our managed content before your original content, resulting in what you can view at https://crawlstop.com/robots.txt.

### No robots.txt file

If your website does not have a `robots.txt` file, Cloudflare creates a new file with our managed block directives and serves it for you.

## Implementation

To implement a `robots.txt` file on your domain:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> 
	<TabItem label="Old dashboard">
		<Steps>
			<Render
				file="enable-managed-robots-txt"
				params={{ one: "Bot Fight Mode" }}
			/>
		</Steps>
	</TabItem> 
	<TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">
		<Steps>
			1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and domain.
			2. Go to **Security** > **Settings**.
			3. Filter by **Bot traffic**.
			4. Go to **Managed robots.txt**. 
			5. Turn **Managed robots.txt** on.
		</Steps>
	</TabItem> 
</Tabs>

## Availability

Managed `robots.txt` for AI crawlers is available on all plans.
