Protect your website or application from AI crawlers by implementing a `robots.txt` file on your domain to direct AI bot operators on what content they can and cannot scrape for AI model training.

Cloudflare's managed `robots.txt` explicitly disallows known bots engaged in scraping for AI purposes.

AI bots are expected to follow the `robots.txt` directives.

## Compatibility with existing `robots.txt` files

Cloudflare will independently check whether your website has an existing `robots.txt` file and update the behavior of this feature based on your website.

### Existing robots.txt file

If your website already has a `robots.txt` file — verified by a HTTP `200` response — Cloudflare will prepend our managed `robots.txt` before your existing `robots.txt`, combining both into a single response.

For example, without this feature enabled, the `robots.txt` content of `crawlstop.com` would be:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /lp
Disallow: /feedback
Disallow: /langtest

Sitemap: https://www.crawlstop.com/sitemap.xml
```

With the managed `robots.txt` enabled, Cloudflare will prepend our managed content before your original content, resulting in what you can view at https://crawlstop.com/robots.txt.

### No robots.txt file

If your website does not have a `robots.txt` file, Cloudflare creates a new file with our managed block directives and serves it for you.

## Implementation

To implement a `robots.txt` file on your domain based on your plan:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Bot Fight Mode">
		<Render
			file="enable-managed-robots-txt"
			params={{ one: "Bot Fight Mode" }}
		/>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Super Bot Fight Mode">
		<Render
			file="enable-managed-robots-txt"
			params={{ one: "Super Bot Fight Mode" }}
		/>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Bot Management for Enterprise">
		<Render
			file="enable-managed-robots-txt"
			params={{ one: "Bot Management" }}
		/>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Availability

Managed `robots.txt` for AI crawlers is available on all plans.
