Protect your website or application from AI crawlers by implementing a `robots.txt` file on your domain to direct AI bot operators on what content they can and cannot scrape for AI model training. 

Cloudflare's managed `robots.txt` explicitly disallows known bots engaged in scraping for AI purposes and AI agent activity. 

AI bots are expected to follow the `robots.txt` directives. Otherwise, they risk getting banned. 

To implement a `robots.txt` file on your domain based on your plan:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bot Fight Mode">
    <Render file="enable-managed-robots-txt" params={{ one: "Bot Fight Mode" }} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Super Bot Fight Mode">
    <Render file="enable-managed-robots-txt" params={{ one: "Super Bot Fight Mode" }} />
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Bot Management for Enterprise">
    <Render file="enable-managed-robots-txt" params={{ one: "Bot Management" }} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
When you enable the `robots.txt` file on your domain, existing `robots.txt` files will be replaced.

## Availability
Managed `robots.txt` for AI crawlers is available on all plans.
