### Examples of Workers Paid pricing
<br/>
#### Example: REST API pricing
If a Workers Paid user uses the REST API for 50 hours during the month, the estimated cost for the month is as follows.

For **browser duration**:
<br/>50 hours - 10 hours (included in plan) = 40 hours
<br/>40 hours × $0.09 per hour = $3.60

#### Example: Workers Bindings pricing
If a Workers paid user uses the Workers Bindings method for 50 hours during the month, and uses 10 concurrent browsers for the first 15 days and 20 concurrent hours the last 15 days, the estimated cost for the month is as follows.

For **browser duration**:
<br/>50 hours - 10 hours (included in plan) = 40 hours
<br/>40 hours × $0.09 per hour = $3.60

For **concurrent browsers**:
<br/>((10 browsers × 15 days) + (20 browsers × 15 days)) = 450 total browsers used in month
<br />450 browsers used in month ÷ 30 days in month = 15 browsers (averaged monthly)
<br/>15 browsers (averaged monthly) − 10 (included in plan) = 5 browsers
<br/>5 browsers × $2.00 per browser = $10.00

For **browser duration** and **concurrent browsers**:
<br/>$3.60 + $10.00 = $13.60
