When using the [REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) to fetch content via Browser Rendering, Cloudflare adds the following headers to outbound requests made to the target URL:

| Header               | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cf-biso-request-id` | A unique identifier for the Browser Rendering request                               |
| `cf-biso-devtools`   | A flag indicating the request originated from Cloudflare's rendering infrastructure |

:::note[Note]

These headers are unique to Browser Rendering and are automatically included and cannot be removed or overridden (such as via `setExtraHTTPHeaders`). They are intended to ensure transparency, allowing destination servers to identify traffic as coming from Cloudflare Browser Rendering.
