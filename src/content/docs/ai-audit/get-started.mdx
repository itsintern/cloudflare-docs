This guide instructs you through

- Viewing AI crawlers that are interacting with your domain.
- Creating a rule to block AI crawlers on your website.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/).
2. [Connect your domain to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).
3. Make sure your domain is [proxying traffic through Cloudflare](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#cloudflare-as-a-reverse-proxy).

## 1. Block all AI crawlers

To use AI Audit:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **AI Audit**.
3. From **Most Popular Paths**, select **Block All**.
4. From the **Bot traffic** page, under **Block AI Bots**, select **Enable**.
</Steps>

	<Render file="list-ai-bots" product="bots" />
</Details>

:::note

For more details on how this rule interacts with other Cloudflare settings, refer to [How it works](/bots/concepts/bot/#how-it-works).

## 2. Block specific bot categories (Enterprise plan only)

Customers on the Enterprise plan -- and with a [Bot Management subscription](/bots/plans/bm-subscription/) -- can choose to only block specific AI crawlers, while allowing others.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
1. Go to the **AI Audit**.
2. From **Most Popular Paths**, select **Block Some**.
3. From the **Security rules** page, select **Create rule** > **Custom rules**.
4. Provide a name for the custom rule. For example, "Block unwanted AI crawlers".
5. From the **Field** dropdown, select **Verified Bot Category**.
6. From the **Value** dropdown, select the specific bot category you wish to block.
   - You can use **And** / **Or** buttons to add additional conditions. For example, you can use multiple **Or** options to include multiple bot categories in the same rule.
7. From the **Then take action...** section:
   - For **Choose action**, select **Block**.
   - For **With response type**, select **Default Cloudflare WAF block page**.
8. From the **Place at** section:
   - For **Select order**, select **First**.
9. Select **Save**.
</Steps>

This custom rule will only block the AI bots which belong to the [verified bot categories](/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/categories/) you have included in your rule (in step 6).

For more information on creating a custom WAF rule, refer to [Create a custom rule in the dashboard](/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/).

## 3. Review detected AI crawlers

Review the AI crawlers detected on your site in the **Metrics** tab of the Cloudflare dashboard for key metrics.

Refer to [Detect AI crawlers](/ai-audit/features/detect-ai-crawlers/) for more information.
