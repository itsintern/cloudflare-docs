## View AI Audit metrics

AI Audit provides you with the following metrics to help you understand how AI crawlers are interacting with your website.

| Metric                            | Description                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Request by AI crawlers            | A graph which displays the number of crawl requests from each AI crawler |
| Summary                           | A list of AI crawlers with the most number of crawl requests             |
| Most popular paths by AI crawlers | The most popular pages crawled by AI crawlers, for each AI crawler       |

The **Summary** table also enables you to [Enforce your robots.txt](/ai-audit/features/enforce-robots-txt/).

## Filter AI crawler data

You can use filters to narrow the scope of your result.

- **Provider:** Filter by the AI crawler owners.
- **Bot type:** Filter by the type of the AI bot (for example, AI crawler, AI assistant, or archiver).
- **Date range:** Filter the date range of your results. You can choose from three predetermined date ranges:
  - Past 7 days
  - Past 14 days
  - Past month

The values of the AI Audit metrics will update according to your filter.

## Filter subdomains

You can use the subdomain filter to narrow the scope of your result.

From the dropdown, select either **All subdomains**, or the specific subdomain you wish to view.

Selecting a specific subdomain allows you to access:

- **Violations only** toggle: Toggles the AI Audit page to only display bots which are violating your configured rules.
- [**Enforce robots.txt policy**](/ai-audit/features/enforce-robots-txt/): Ensure bots cannot access webpages which are off-limits, as specified in your `robots.txt` file.

The values of the AI Audit metrics will update according to your filter.
