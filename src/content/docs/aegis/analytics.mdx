Use the [GraphQL API](/analytics/graphql-api/) to get aggregate data and monitor your Aegis IPs capacity. As explained in [IPs allocation](/aegis/about/ips-allocation/), each Aegis IP can support 40,000 concurrent connections per origin IP.

Refer to the GraphQL Analytics API documentation to [get started](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/). The specific Aegis schema is called `aegisIpUtilizationAdaptiveGroups`.

You can get average (`avg`) or maximum (`max`) utilization values (in percentage), and use the following dimensions:

- `datetimeFiveMinutes` <Type text="time" />
    - Timestamp truncated to five minutes. For example, `2025-01-10T00:05:00Z`.

- `popName` <Type text="string" />
    - The Cloudflare point of presence (PoP). For example, `sjc`.

- `egressIp` <Type text="string" />
    - Your assigned Aegis IP. For example, `192.0.2.1`.

- `origin` <Type text="string" />
    - Origin IP and port. For example, `203.0.113.150:443`.

- `popUtilizationKey` <Type text="string" />
    - The Cloudflare point of presence (PoP), the Aegis IP, and the origin IP and port. For example, `sjc 192.0.2.1 203.0.113.150:443`.
