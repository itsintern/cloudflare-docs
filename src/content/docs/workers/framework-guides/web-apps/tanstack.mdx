## What is TanStack Start?

TanStack Start is a full-stack React framework powered by TanStack Router. It provides a full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling, and more using tools like Nitro and Vite.

## Create a new TanStack Start

TanStack provides a start-basic project. We'll use this starter project to create a new TanStack Start application.

<Steps>

1.  **Create a new TanStack Start project**

    ```sh
    npx gitpick TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/start-basic start-basic
    cd start-basic
    npm install
    ```

        <Details header="How is this project set up?">
        			This command will clone the TanStack Start basic project to your local machine, change directory to the project, and install the dependencies. TanStack [provides other examples](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start#examples) that you can use by replacing `start-basic` with the example you want to use.
        </Details>

2.  **Develop locally**

    After creating your project, run the following command in your project directory to start a local development server. By default this starts a local development server on `http://localhost:3000/`

    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

</Steps>

## Preparing for Deployment to Cloudflare Workers

Whether you created a new TanStack Start project or are using an existing project, you'll need to make some changes to prepare for deployment to Cloudflare Workers.

<Steps>

1. **Install `unenv` & `nitroCloudflareBindings` package**

   [`unenv`](https://github.com/unjs/unenv) is a package that normalizes runtime environments across Node.js, browsers, and edge runtimes like Cloudflare Workers. Itâ€™s essential for TanStack Router because certain Node.js APIs are unavailable in the Workers environment. `unenv` offers compatible replacements for those APIs.

   [`nitro-cloudflare-dev`](https://github.com/nitrojs/nitro-cloudflare-dev) enables access to the Cloudflare runtime bindings like R2, D1, and other Cloudflare services in the development server.

   <PackageManagers pkg="unenv nitro-cloudflare-dev" />

2. **Modify the `app.config.ts` file**

   To configure your application for Cloudflare Workers deployment, add the following lines to your `app.config.ts` file:

   ```ts
   // Required imports
   import { cloudflare } from 'unenv'
   import nitroCloudflareBindings from "nitro-cloudflare-dev";

   // Add this new server section to the defineConfig object
   server: {
   	preset: "cloudflare-module",
   	unenv: cloudflare,
   	modules: [nitroCloudflareBindings],
   },
   ```

   This will set the correct build format and runtime environment for Cloudflare.

3. **Add a Wrangler file**

   Create a `wrangler.jsonc` or `wrangler.toml` file in the root of your project, `wrangler.jsonc` is the recommended approach. This file is used to configure the Cloudflare Workers deployment.

   <WranglerConfig>

   ```json
   {
   	"$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
   	"name": "start-basic",
   	"main": "./.output/server/index.mjs",
   	"compatibility_date": "2025-04-14",
   	"observability": {
   		"enabled": true
   	},
   	"assets": {
   		"directory": "./.output/public/"
   	},
   	"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]
   }
   ```

   </WranglerConfig>

   Note that the `directory` key is set to `.output/public/`, which is the folder that will be filled with the build output. Additionally, the `main` key is set to `.output/server/index.mjs`, indicating to Cloudflare Workers where to locate the entry point for your application.

4. **Build the application**

   You must build your application before deploying it to Cloudflare Workers.

   <PackageManagers type="run" args={"build"} />

5. **Deploy the application**

   The command below will deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers and provide a deployment URL. Make sure to rebuild your application after making any changes to see those changes reflected in the deployment.

   ```sh
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

   When making changes in the future ensure you rebuild your application. The deploy will deploy what is in your `.output/public` folder and that only gets updated when you run the build command.

</Steps>

## Using Cloudflare Bindings

<Steps>

1. **Create a helper function to get access to Cloudflare bindings**

   Create a helper function named `cloudflareBindings.ts` in the `src/utils` folder, and paste in the below code. You can create a `utils` folder in your project if you don't already have one. The example assumes you have a KV namespace with a binding name of `CACHE` already created in your account and added to the wrangler file.

   ```ts
   import type { KVNamespace } from "@cloudflare/workers-types";

   interface CloudflareBindings {
   	CACHE: KVNamespace;
   }
   /**
    * Will only work when being accessed on the server. Obviously, CF bindings are not available in the browser.
    * @returns
    */
   export async function getBindings() {
   	if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
   		const { getPlatformProxy } = await import("wrangler");
   		const { env } = await getPlatformProxy();
   		return env as unknown as CloudflareBindings;
   	}

   	return process.env as unknown as CloudflareBindings;
   }
   ```

   <Details header="How is this code working?">
   	To ensure your bindings work locally with vinxi, the helper function uses
   	[getPlatformProxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#getplatformproxy)
   	method from wrangler. This logic is placed under a check if
   	import.meta.env.DEV is true.
   </Details>

2. **Example using a Cloudflare Binding**

   Now that you have a helper function to get access to your Cloudflare bindings, you can use them in your application.

   Remember bindings are only available on the server.

   ```ts
   const bindings = await getBindings();
   const cache = bindings.CACHE;
   const queryCount = (await cache.get("queryCount")) || "0";
   await cache.put("queryCount", String(Number(queryCount) + 1));
   ```

   A special thanks to GitHub user [backpine](https://github.com/backpine) for the code that supports Cloudflare Bindings in TanStack, which is demonstrated in their [TanStack Start on Workers example](https://github.com/backpine/tanstack-start-on-cloudflare-workers-v0).

</Steps>

#### Optional: Update utils file with deployment URL

This step is required for the `/users` page to function properly in the `start-basic` example. Update the `/src/utils/users.tsx` file with the Cloudflare Workers deployment URL.

```ts
export const DEPLOY_URL = "YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL";
```

By following the steps above, you will have deployed your TanStack Start application to Cloudflare Workers.
