## Background

Connect to databases by configuring connection strings and credentials as [secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets/) in your Worker. 

:::note[Making multiple round trip calls to a centralized database from a Worker?]


If your Worker is making multiple round trip calls to a centralized database, your Worker may be a good fit for Smart Placement. Smart Placement speeds up applications by automatically running your Worker closer to your back-end infrastructure rather than the end user. Learn more about [how Smart Placement works](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/).

## Database credentials

When you rotate or update database credentials, you must update the corresponding [secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets/) in your Worker. Use the [`wrangler secret put`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret) command to update secrets securely or update the secret directly in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/services/view/:worker/production/settings).

## Database limits

You can connect to multiple databases by configuring separate sets of secrets for each database connection. Use descriptive secret names to distinguish between different database connections (for example, `DATABASE_URL_PROD` and `DATABASE_URL_STAGING`).
