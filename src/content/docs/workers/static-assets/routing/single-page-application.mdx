Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications which are client-side rendered (CSR). They are often built with a framework such as [React](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/), [Vue](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/vue/) or [Svelte](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/svelte/). The build process of these frameworks will produce a single `/index.html` file and accompanying client-side resources (e.g. JavaScript bundles, CSS stylesheets, images, fonts, etc.). Typically, data is fetched by the client from an API with client-side requests.

## Configuration

In order to deploy a Single Page Application to Workers, you must configure the `assets.directory` and `assets.not_found_handling` options in your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#assets):

<WranglerConfig>

```json
{
	"name": "my-worker",
	"compatibility_date": "$today",
	"assets": {
		"directory": "./dist/",
		"not_found_handling": "single-page-application"
	}
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

Configuring `assets.not_found_handling` to `single-page-application` overrides the default serving behavior of Workers for static assets. When an incoming request does not match a file in the `assets.directory`, Workers will serve the contents of the `/index.html` file with a `200 OK` status.

## Local Development

If you are using a Vite-powered SPA framework, you might be interested in using our [Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/) which offers a Vite-native developer experience.
