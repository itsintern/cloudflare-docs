This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) MySQL database.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing PlanetScale database by creating a new user and fetching your database connection string.

### Planetscale Dashboard

1. Go to the [**PlanetScale dashboard**](https://app.planetscale.com/) and select the database you wish to connect to.
2. Click **Connect**. Enter `hyperdrive-user` as the password name (or your preferred name) and configure the permissions as desired. Select **Create password**. Note the username and password as they will not be displayed again.
3. Select **Other** as your language or framework. Note down the database host, database name, database username, and password. You will need these to create a database configuration in Hyperdrive.

With the host, database name, username and password, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration
