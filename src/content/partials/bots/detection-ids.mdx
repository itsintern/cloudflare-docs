Detection IDs are static rules used to detect predictable bot behavior with no overlap with human traffic. Detection IDs refer to the precise [detection](/bots/concepts/bot-detection-engines/) used to identify a bot, which could be from heuristics, verified bot detections, or anomaly detections. For example, a detection ID can identify if you sent your headers in a different order than what was expected of your browser.
