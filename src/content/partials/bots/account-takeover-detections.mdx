Using the detection IDs below, you can detect and mitigate account takeover attacks. You can monitor the number of login requests for a given software and network combination, as well as the percentage of login errors. When it reaches a suspicious level, you can prevent these attacks by using [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/), [rate limiting rules](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), and [Workers](/workers/).

| Detection ID | Description                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `201326592`  | Observes all login failures to the zone. |
| `201326593`  | Observes all login traffic to the zone.  |
| `201326598`  | Sets a dynamic threshold based on the normal traffic that is unique to the zone.<br /><br /> When the ID matches a login failure, Bot Management sets the [bot score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) to 2 and [anomaly detection](/bots/concepts/bot-detection-engines/#anomaly-detection-enterprise) as its score source. |
