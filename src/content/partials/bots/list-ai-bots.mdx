In addition to this list, [verified bots](https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots#verified-bots) that are classified in AI-related categories such as `AI Assistant`, `AI Crawler`, or an `Archiver`, as well as a number of unverified bots that behave similarly, are included in the rule. This rule does not include verified bots that fall into the `Search Engine` categories.

These categories, and the bots classified in these categories, may change from time to time.

If you are a bot operator and feel your bot may have been incorrectly categorized, [add your bot to the list of verified bots](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/configurations/verified-bots).
