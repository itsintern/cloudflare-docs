JavaScript Detections is a type of Challenge separate from Cloudflare’s Challenge Pages or Turnstile. Javascript Detections helps Cloudflare's [bot solutions](/bots/) identify automated requests. 

While Challenge Pages and Turnstile rely on client-side signals to determine the authenticity of a request, Bot Management’s JavaScript Detections relies on network-side signals and run on every single request made to your website.
