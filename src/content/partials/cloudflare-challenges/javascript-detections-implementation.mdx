Once you enable JavaScript detections, you must use the `cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed` field to create [WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) (or the `request.cf.botManagement.jsDetection.passed` variable in [Workers](/workers/)).

When adding this field to WAF custom rules, it is used on endpoints expecting browser traffic (avoiding native mobile applications or websocket endpoints), after a user's first request to your application (Cloudflare needs at least one HTML request before injecting JavaScript detection), and with the Managed Challenge action, because there are legitimate reasons a user might not have passed a JavaScript Detection challenge (network issues, ad blockers, disabled JavaScript in browser, native mobile applications).

### Prerequisites

- You must have JavaScript Detections enabled on your zone.
- You must have [updated your Content Security Policy headers](/cloudflare-challenges/challenge-types/javascript-detections/#if-you-have-a-content-security-policy-csp) for JavaScript detections.
- You must not run this field on websocket endpoints.
- You must use the field in a custom rules expression that expects only browser traffic.
- The action should always be a managed challenge in case a legitimate user has not received the challenge for network or browser reasons.
- The path specified in the rule builder should never be the first HTML page a user visits when browsing your site.

The `cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed` field should never be used in a WAF custom rule that matches a visitor's first request to a site. It is necessary to have at least one HTML request before Cloudflare can inject JavaScript detection.
