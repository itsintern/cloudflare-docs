1. Go to **Settings** > **Network**.

3. Select **TCP**.
4. (Recommended) To proxy traffic to internal DNS resolvers, select **UDP**.
5. (Recommended) To proxy traffic for diagnostic tools such as `ping` and `traceroute`, select **ICMP**. You may also need to [update your system](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/troubleshoot-tunnels/common-errors/#ping-and-traceroute-commands-do-not-work) to allow ICMP traffic through `cloudflared`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform (v5)">

Proxy settings are not currently supported by the Terraform v5 provider (as of version 5.3.0). To turn on the Gateway proxy, use the dashboard or API.

Cloudflare will now proxy traffic from enrolled devices, except for the traffic excluded in your [split tunnel settings](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/#3-route-private-network-ips-through-warp). For more information on how Gateway forwards traffic, refer to [Gateway proxy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/proxy/).
