You can customize the Cloudflare-hosted block page by making global changes that Gateway will display every time a user reaches your block page. Customizations will apply regardless of the type of policy (DNS or HTTP) that blocks the traffic.

To customize your block page:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.
2. Under **Account Gateway block page**, select **Customize**.
3. Choose **Custom Gateway block page**. Gateway will display a preview of your custom block page. Available customizations include:
   - Your organization's name
   - [Logo](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/block-page/#add-a-logo-image)
   - Header text
   - Global block message, which will be displayed above the policy-specific block message
   - [Mailto link](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/block-page/#allow-users-to-email-an-administrator)
   - Background color
4. Select **Save**.

Gateway will now display a custom Gateway block page when your users visit a blocked website.
