By default, Cloudflare will evaluate Access application policies after evaluating all Gateway network policies. To evaluate Access applications before or after specific Gateway policies, create the following [Gateway network policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/):

| Selector                     | Operator | Value     | Action |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| {props.selector}             | is       | _Present_ | Allow  |

You can move this policy in the Gateway policy builder to change its [order of precedence](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/order-of-enforcement/#order-of-precedence).

:::note
Users must pass the policies in your Access application before they are granted access. The Gateway Allow policy is strictly for routing and connectivity purposes.
