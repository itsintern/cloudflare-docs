## Local development

During local development, your Worker code always executes locally and bindings connect to locally simulated resources [by default](/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings).

You can configure [**remote bindings** during local development](/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings), allowing your bindings to connect to a deployed resource on a per-binding basis.

- **Local simulations:** Bindings connect to local resource simulations. Supported in [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/).

- **Remote binding connections:** Bindings connect to remote resources via `experimental_remote: true` configuration. Supported in [`wrangler dev --x-remote-bindings`](/workers/development-testing/#using-wrangler-with-remote-bindings) and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/development-testing/#using-vite-with-remote-bindings).

## Remote development

During remote development, all of your Worker code is uploaded and executed on Cloudflare's infrastructure, and bindings always connect to remote resources. **We recommend using local development with remote binding connections instead** for faster iteration and debugging.

Supported only in [`wrangler dev --remote`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) - there is **no Vite plugin equivalent**.
