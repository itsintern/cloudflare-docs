## Security level

Cloudflare provides _I'm Under Attack!_ as a security level.

Cloudflare's Under Attack mode performs additional security checks to help mitigate layer 7 DDoS attacks.

When you select _I'm Under Attack!_, which enables [Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/), Cloudflare will present a JS challenge page.

:::caution

Only use [Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/) when a website is under a DDoS attack. Under Attack mode may affect some actions on your domain, such as your API traffic.

To set a custom security level for your API or any other part of your domain, create a [configuration rule](/rules/configuration-rules/).
