1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select **{props.productPathDash}**.
3. From the **Tunnels** tab, select **Create**.
4. On the **Add tunnels** page, choose either a **GRE tunnel** or **IPsec tunnel**.

<Details header="GRE tunnel">

5. In **Name**, give your tunnel a descriptive name. This name must be unique, must not contain spaces or special characters, and must be 15 or fewer characters. Hover the mouse over `i` in the dashboard for more information.
6. Give your tunnel a description in **Description**. You do not have character restrictions here.
7. In **IPv4 Interface address**, enter the internal IP address for your tunnel along with the interface's prefix length (either `/31` or `/30`). This is used to route traffic through the tunnel on the Cloudflare side. We recommend using an RFC1918 address scheme with a `/31` netmask, as it provides the most efficient use of IP address space.
8. In **Customer GRE endpoint**, enter your router's public IP address. This value is not needed if you intend to use a physical or virtual connection like Cloudflare Network Interconnect because Cloudflare will provide it.
9. In **Cloudflare GRE endpoint**, enter the anycast address you received from your account team.
10. Leave the default values for **TTL** and **MTU**.
11. _(Optional)_ **Tunnel health checks** are enabled by default. If you disable Tunnel health checks, your tunnels will appear 100% down in your <a href={props.tunnelHealthDash}>tunnel health dashboard</a> even when working. Cloudflare will keep sending traffic through the tunnel, without the means to detect if the tunnel goes down. You will have to set up your own system to detect down tunnels, as Cloudflare will not be able to warn you about down tunnels. Refer to <a href={props.productPathProbe}>Tunnel health checks</a> for more information.
12. _(Optional)_ If you keep **Tunnel health checks** enabled, choose the <a href={props.healthCheck}>**Health check rate**</a> for your tunnel. Available options are _Low_, _Medium_, and _High_.
13. The **Health check type** defaults to _Reply_ and to creating an ICMP reply. If your firewall drops this type of packet for assuming it is a type of attack, change this option to _Request_ which will create an ICMP request. Refer to <a href={props.productPathProbe}>Tunnel health checks</a> for more information.
14. The **Health check direction** defaults to **{props.BiVsUniHealthCheck}** for {props.productName}. Refer to [Bidirectional vs unidirectional health checks](#bidirectional-vs-unidirectional-health-checks) for more details.
15. _(Optional)_ **Health check target** is the customer end of the tunnel. This field is only visible when the **Health check direction** is set to _Unidirectional_.
16. _(Optional)_ We recommend you test your tunnel before officially adding it. To test the tunnel, select **Test tunnels**.
17. To add multiple tunnels, select **Add GRE tunnel** for each new tunnel.
18. After adding your tunnel information, select **Add tunnels** to save your changes.

<Details header="IPsec tunnel">

5. In **Name**, give your tunnel a descriptive name. This name must be unique, must not contain spaces or special characters, and must be 15 or fewer characters. Hover the mouse over `i` in the dashboard for more information.
6. Give your tunnel a description in **Description**. You do not have character restrictions here.
7. In **IPv4 Interface address**, enter the internal IP address for your tunnel along with the interface's prefix length (either `/31` or `/30`). This is used to route traffic through the tunnel on the Cloudflare side. We recommend using an RFC1918 address scheme with a `/31` netmask, as it provides the most efficient use of IP address space.
8. In **Customer endpoint**, enter your router's public IP address. This value is only required if your router is using an IKE ID of type `ID_IPV4_ADDR`.
9. In **Cloudflare endpoint**, enter the anycast address you received from your account team.
10. _(Optional)_ **Tunnel health checks** are enabled by default. If you disable Tunnel health checks, your tunnels will appear 100% down in your <a href={props.tunnelHealthDash}>tunnel health dashboard</a> even when working. Cloudflare will keep sending traffic through the tunnel, without the means to detect if the tunnel goes down. You will have to set up your own system to detect down tunnels, as Cloudflare will not be able to warn you about down tunnels. Refer to <a href={props.productPathProbe}>Tunnel health checks</a> for more information.
11. _(Optional)_ If you keep **Tunnel health checks** enabled, choose the <a href={props.healthCheck}>**Health check rate**</a> for your tunnel. Available options are _Low_, _Medium_ and _High_.
12. _(Optional)_ The **Health check type** defaults to _Reply_ and to creating an ICMP reply. If your firewall drops this type of packet for assuming it is a type of attack, change this option to _Request_ which will create an ICMP request. Refer to <a href={props.productPathProbe}>Tunnel health checks</a> for more information.
13. _(Optional)_ The **Health check direction** defaults to **{props.BiVsUniHealthCheck}** for {props.productName}. Refer to [Bidirectional vs unidirectional health checks](#bidirectional-vs-unidirectional-health-checks) for more details.
14. _(Optional)_ **Health check target** is the customer end of the tunnel. This field is only visible when the **Health check direction** is set to _Unidirectional_.

    :::note
    IPsec tunnels will not function without a pre-shared key (PSK).
    :::

15. If you do not have a pre-shared key yet:

    1. Select **Add pre-shared key later**.
    2. _(Optional)_ We recommend you test your tunnel configuration before officially adding it. To test the tunnel, select **Test tunnels**.
    3. Select **Add tunnels**.
    4. The Cloudflare dashboard will load the list of tunnels you have configured. The IPsec tunnel you have just created will be listed with a warning in the form of a triangle to let you know it is not yet functional. Select **Edit**.
    5. Choose **Generate a new pre-shared key** > **Update and generate a pre-shared key**. Save the key to a safe place, and select **Done**.

16. If you already have a pre-shared key:

    1. Select **Use my own pre-shared key**.
    2. Paste your key in **Your pre-shared key**.
    3. _(Optional)_ We recommend you test your tunnel before officially adding it. To test the tunnel, select **Test tunnels**.
    4. Select **Add tunnels**.

17. (Optional) Enable **Replay protection** if you have devices that do not support disabling it. Refer to <a href={props.antiReplayPagePath}>Anti-replay protection</a> for more information.

<Details header="IPsec tunnel">

1. Create a `POST` request [using the API](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/ipsec_tunnels/methods/create/) to create an IPsec tunnel.

	Note that in example below, replay protection is disabled by default. You can enable it with the flag `"replay_protection": true` for each IPsec tunnel, if the devices you use do not support disabling this feature. If you have already created IPsec tunnels, update them with a [`PUT` request](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/ipsec_tunnels/methods/update/). Refer to <a href={props.antiReplayPagePath}>Anti-replay protection</a> for more information on this topic.

	<APIRequest

		method="POST"
		json={{
			"name": "<TUNNEL_NAME>",
			"description": "<TUNNEL_DESCRIPTION>",
			"interface_address": "<INTERFACE_ADDRESS>",

	```

	Take note of the tunnel `id` value. We will use it to generate a pre-shared key (PSK).

2. Create a `POST` [request](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/ipsec_tunnels/methods/psk_generate/) to generate a PSK. Use the tunnel `id` value you received from the previous command.

	<APIRequest
		path="/accounts/{account_id}/magic/ipsec_tunnels/{ipsec_tunnel_id}/psk_generate"
		method="POST"
	/>

	```json output
	{
		"result": {

			}
		},
		"success": true,
		"errors": [],
		"messages": []
	}
	```

	Take note of your `psk` value.

3. Create a `PUT` [request](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/ipsec_tunnels/methods/update/) to update your IPsec tunnel with the PSK.

	<CURL
		url="https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/ipsec_tunnels/{ipsec_tunnel_id}"

4. Use the `psk` value from step 3 to configure the IPsec tunnel on your equipment as well.
